# Repo for NLP Emotionality of Fake News Project

## Contributors: Adam Harris, Elizaveta Baranova-Parfenova, Ismalia Elimane Ly, Adrian Duszkiewicz

### Current Plan: 

- Read up on how regular expressions work

- Clean and preprocess kaggle fake-news dataset

- Find approproate package to quantify emotionality across desired dimensions
  
- Choose embedding method to numerically represent article 

- Test simple (e.g. linear) classification methods, like logistic regression or support vector machine

- Choose NN architecture (start simple, MLP)

- Create NN in pytorch to classify fake vs real news based on: text embedding; text embedding + emotion scores; just emotion scores
